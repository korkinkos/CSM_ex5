# Ex5, group members: Maksim Feldman, Konstantin Korkin, Benedikt Schier, Nikolaus Felder

Included in the main branch are: 

- `Ex5.ipynb` : Our main submission, implementation of all tasks as described in EX5

- `EX5_multiprocessing.py` : modified version of main submission, implemented multi-processing via pools, .py since this code didn't work in Jupyter notebooks but does in standalone python files. Resulting speedup: ca. 2-3x on 8 cores

- `Plots.pdf` : Resulting plots after M = 90 minimizations of random Lennard-Jones clusters of sizes 2:19
